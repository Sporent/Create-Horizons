      "In addition, the &&6cost &&rof enchanting items has been reworked. You can now pay for enchantments using either &&6lapis, experience, or the material that the item is made from. &&rAdding &&6bookshelves &&raround the enchantment table will &&6decrease the cost &&rof applying an enchantment.",
